Professional Google Certified Architect - pca-exam-codyversion. Important: The PCA exam code already works fine but it only reads and displays the exam questions and answer options. It doesn't keep track of the responses or scores the answers. Note to Hector: The code has been tested and works fine in the new version of the PCA exam using SourceGraph Cody.
